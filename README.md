This file dump was created from an R36H that was ordered at the end of Nov. 2025. These devices go through silent hardware revisions so if this does not work for you, you may need to find a newer dump.


# H1 Installing Rocknix on the R36H

I also did not find the Rocknix install process smooth, so here are some tips. 

First, using rufus, follow these instructions as if you had an R36S for steps 1 and 2: https://rocknix.org/play/install/

Before removing your flash drive, take the [overlays.zip](https://github.com/mstrblueskys/R36H/blob/main/overlays.zip) from this repo, extract, and take the overlays folder and copy it to your rocknix card

Insert in the OS drive slot and boot your R36H
